 * The Utility component is a set of tools separated from the main component.
 *
 * On contrast to the other Utility component included in the Common component, all the utility tools included in this component are not part of the core component of the framework.
 * Each tool serves its own functionality independently and does not rely on other components.
 * So even if you don't include the framework core files, still you can use these tools by copying the files into your project.
