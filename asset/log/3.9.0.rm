- Added the `contact` built-in field type.
- Added the `selector` argument to the `select2` custom field type that enables to show/hide elements on selection.
- Refined the `path` custom field type due to the deprecation of the `jQueryFileTree` library and switching to `jstree`, which involves deprecation of some arguments and UI improvements.  
- Refined tooltips.
- Added the ability for tooltips to include `a` tags.
- Added the `width` argument for the `tip` field argument.
- Fixed an issue that tooltips created with the `tip` field argument made the document width wider than the initial width.
- Fixed an issue that class names and text domains of sub-files of custom field types were not converted when building.  
- Changed the behavior of loading framework resources (stylesheets and JavaScript scripts) from internally to externally for most cases.    
- Deprecated the `email` argument of the `submit` field type.
